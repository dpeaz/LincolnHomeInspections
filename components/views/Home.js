        Launched in February 2023, Bitcorns is an OG Bitcoin Ordinals collection
        inscribed from 39k-47k. How early were we? There have now been over 50
        million Ordinals inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain! The collection was
        built on originality, memes, Bitcoin culture, and a strong community. As
        our earliest supporters, Bitcorns holders will always have access to the
        highest level of benefits to include airdrops, allowlists, giveaways,
        contests, and alpha.
