# Project Planning

## Write a Definition Statement

I want to build an application that presents an overview of a specific Bitmap Ordinal and helps determine the value based on its traits; to be nested under the Bitcorns (Ordinals/NFT) website.
<br>

## Define your Audience
### Who is using my application

- Demographics: males, 20-40 years old
- Interests: Blockchain, Technology, Cryptocurrency, NFTs
- Social Media/Chat: Twitter, Discord, Telegram
<br>

## Outline the content of the application
### What do I want on each page? (text / pics / images / navigation)

See user flow/wireframes

### What do I want the functionality of each page to be?

See user flow/wireframes

### What is the purpose of my application?

Simplify the process of pricing users' Bitmaps Ordinal when planning to sell. SPA will help prevent mispricing and potentially losing money.

### What business problem or real world problem am I going to be solving?

With current tools, it's too easy to accidentally underprice Bitmaps Ordinals.

## Research the following:
### List Applications Researched: (links to websites / applications)

[bitmap.community](https://bitmap.community/)
[bitmap.rcsv](https://bitmap.rcsv.io/)

### List what you like about each site:
- bitmap.community
  - nice overview
  - closest to my idea
  - contains a mass amount of data about each Bitmap
- bitmap.rcsv
  - shows holder percentages
  - has a map version
  - implements wallet connect

### List what you do not like about each site:
- bitmap.community
  - missing floor prices for each trait
  - does not display image of Ordinal
  - confusing rarity algorithm
  - loads slow
- bitmap.rcsv
  - loads slow/memory intensive
  - UI/UX is confusing
  - doesn't list much data about each Bitmap

### How my application will be different:

Faster loading with a snapshot of floor prices of each trait for a specific Bitmap.
